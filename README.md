**Squares** 

**Instructions:**
Use your cursor (a black circle) to collect as many black squares as you can. 

DON'T touch the red squares - you lose the game if you do! 

As you collect more squares: your circle will get bigger, the speed of the squares will increase, and more squares will appear!
